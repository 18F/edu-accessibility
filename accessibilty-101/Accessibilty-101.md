Accessibilty 101

This is the first section of the course. This section should aim to introduce students to the concept and importance of the course. Technical details, techniques, examples, and tools to achieve course goals should be saved for future sections. This section will be most effective if it is short, uses plain language, and builds an understanding of the importance of this course that the student will take with them through the rest of the material. 

## Goals - In this section, students should learn:
- What accessibility is
- Why itâ€™s important
- What 508 compliance is
- Why we should think of this work as striving for accessibility and not just 508 compliance
- Beyond 508: Other standards, specifically Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)
- What is coming up next in this course
