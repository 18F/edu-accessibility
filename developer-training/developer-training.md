Developer training

This is the bulk of the course. Since this section contains a lot of
detailed, technical, and critically important content, it’s important
that it be divided into manageable modules. This section will be
successful if it assumes the lowest level of technical knowledge
necessary, focuses on plain language standards and their solutions,
allows students to practice individual skills before moving on to the
next section. Though this section deals with federal regulations,
modules should strive to use plain language and frame recommendations as
desirable because they improve accessibility and not simply because they
fulfill a federal regulation.

**Goals** - In this section, students should learn:

-   Accessibility standards and requirements

-   Ways to meet those standards

-   Ways to evaluate their work

-   What it’s like to use tools made for those with accessibility challenges, for example screen readers
