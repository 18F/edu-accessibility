Project resources
-----------------

These are a small number of resources that developers or project leads
will be required to use on every project they complete. These will also
be linked to from the resources page, but they are a separate, required
form. Currently, these exist as Google Sheets documents. The proposed
change is to convert them to a Google Form so responses can be tracked
and changes to course materials can be made accordingly.

**Resources**

[Dev checklist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KoUFdxSFJ5HRHXCPSEf1DGCRUR4pV57uj8lWR8DT4IE/edit#heading=h.bvylgbutm462)

**Goals** - These materials should:

-   Be concise

-   Use plain language

-   Fit well into developer or project lead workflow

-   Be designed so responses can be easily captured and analyzed later
