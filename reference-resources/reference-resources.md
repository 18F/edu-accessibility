Post course reference resources 
--------------------------------

This section will provide resources that students can use in the future
to quickly look up material from the course. It will also include links
to tools and applications that students can use to evaluate their own
future work and improve their accessibility compliance. This section
will succeed if the resources and tools are relevant, well organized,
and easy for students to apply to the best practices they learned in
previous sections.
