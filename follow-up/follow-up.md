Follow up
---------

This section is meant to include follow-up materials that will benefit
both students and teachers. These materials will be successful if they
are low-impact enough to have a high completion rate and if they provide
meaningful feedback to teachers that can be used to improve the course
curriculum.

**Goals** - These materials should:

-   Be easy to complete

-   Capture and deliver results to teachers

-   Address topics covered in the first two sections of the course

-   Have content that is easy to change
