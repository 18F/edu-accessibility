Evaluation
----------

This section will evaluate how well students learned information from
the two previous sections. The proposed format for this section will be
a repo of a mock site with numerous accessibility problems that students
would clone, edit, and then push back up so that teachers could evaluate
their comprehension in a real-world scenario. This section will succeed
if the evaluation models real world situations, covers a wide range of
accessibility topics, integrates written evaluation of Accessibility 101
with developer evaluation, and has a mechanism to record and track
scores over time.

**Goals** - This section should:

-   Be able to easily access the evaluation

-   Require the fewest number of tools to complete

-   Cover a wide range of topics

-   Be easy to grade

-   Be easy to track student results and progress
